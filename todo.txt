-make arc in meta for lib.blis soft arc-agnostic(just works for zen2 atm)
-find all flags required for it to work with program module(might have to use pre-processing script to extract dif flags for dif OS)
	*add DBLIS and DBLIS_VERSION_STRING so that BLAS is defined in c files
	*find how to compile for all three libs

-look into adding autotuning(could be a solution for above)
